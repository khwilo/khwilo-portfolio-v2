      <p>
        I am a software engineer with experience in the field of mobile web
        application development. I am passionate about bringing great
        experiences to users on the web by creating fast, responsive and
        interactive web applications. When not working, I enjoy using my time by
        sharing what I learn through writing technical articles and also
        assisting other developers in leveling up their skills.
